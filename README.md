# MadEye
A Keylogger built on WinUI 3 (C#)

<h2>Overview</h2>
MadEye is a keylogger project built using WinUI 3 and C#. It is designed to serve as a report viewer. For capturing data I have created the RecServ (A saperate program).
Please note that this project is still in its alpha version and may have several issues.
