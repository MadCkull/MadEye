**MadEye:**
A Keylogger built on WinUI 3 (C#)

**Overview:**
MadEye is a keylogger project built using WinUI 3 and C#. It is designed to serve as a report viewer. For capturing data I have created the RecServ (A saperate program).
Please note that this project is still in its alpha version and may have several issues.

**Contributing:**
I welcome contributions from the open-source community to enhance MadEye and RecServ. Please don't hesitate to reach out for more information. Your support is greatly appreciated.

**Note:**
For additional information about RecServ, please refer to my repositories.
